# CHIMERA: Combining HIstology, Medical Imaging (Radiology), and molEcular Data for Medical pRognosis and diAgnosis.

Welcome to the CHIMERA challenge repository! This challenge aims to accelerate research in multimodal AI for cancer prognosis by providing standardized tasks integrating histopathology, radiology, clinical, and transcriptomic data.

## ðŸš€ Overview

CHIMERA is a MICCAI 2025 challenge consisting of **three multimodal tasks**:

| Task | Description                                                                 |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Predict biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer using histology + MRI + clinical data |
| 2    | Predict BCG response subtype (BRS) in bladder cancer from H&E + clinical data |
| 3    | Predict recurrence in NMIBC using histology + RNA-seq + clinical dat          |

All tasks involve gigapixel WSIs, structured data, and standard clinical endpoints.
